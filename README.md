# Personal portfolio with terminal-based theme

used for my own portfolio <a href='http://jmjumper.de'>jmjumper.de</a> <br />
It is actually not even finished but it is already somewhat usable. <br />
Oh and btw, I implemented a small easter-egg for all Linux-savvy hehe<br />

As always, the code is garbage and unorganized as hell. But understand this as a matter of art which represents my love towards the React framework. And not only towards React but towards JavaScript in general. It is awful.

If you want to download the code: clone the repo -> ```npm install``` -> ```npm start -> done
